            2   What Is NoSQL 

                         "NoSQL" (Not only SQL) refers to a broad 
                          category of database management systems (DBMS)
                          that diverge from the traditional relational 
                          database management systems (RDBMS) that use SQL
                          (Structured Query Language). NoSQL databases are
                          designed to handle large volumes of structured, 
                          semi-structured, and unstructured data more flexibly

            4    Keys gives a identity of each data
                 the 7 different types of keys in DBMS


                     1 Primary Key
                     2 Foreign Key
                     3 Super Key
                     4 Unique Key(ARtificial Key)
                     5 Composite Key
                     6 Alternative Key
                     7 Candidate Key


            5    In the context of databases,
                 keys are crucial for organizing
                 and accessing data efficiently. 
                 They help establish relationships 
                 between tables and enforce data integrity 
                 rules. Here are the main types of keys in a database:


               1. Primary Key:
                        Primary cannot be duplicate
                        A primary key is a unique identifier for 
                        each record (row) in a table.
                        It must contain unique values 
                        It cannot be NULL.
                        Each table has only one primary key.
                        Example: employee_id in an employees table.
                 
                 
              2. Foreign Key:
                    A foreign key is a column of 
                    table that refers to the primary key 
                    in another table.
                    It establishes a link between 
                    two tables, enforcing referential integrity.
                    Example: department_id in an employees table, 
                     referring to the department_id primary key in 
                     a departments table.
                     Means one column is similar in two different table


                3. Unique Key:
    
                     A unique key ensures that all values in a 
                     column (or set of columns) are unique.
                     Unlike a primary key, it can contain NULL
                    values (but only one NULL per column if 
                    the key is single-column).
                    Example: email column in a users table might
                    be a unique key to ensure no two users have 
                    the same email address.
    
    
    
                4. Composite Key:
    
                    A composite key is a key that consists of more
                    than one column to uniquely identify a record.
                    Together, the combination of columns must be unique.
                    Example: A combination of product_id and store_id in
                    a stock table might form a composite key to uniquely
                    identify inventory records for specific products in 
                    specific stores.

    
    
              5. Super Key:
                    Super key is group  of single or multiple Keys
                    which  identifies rows in a table
    
                   A super key is a set of one or more columns that can
                   uniquely identify a record within a table.
                   It may include more columns than necessary to
                   uniquely identify a record.
                  Example: A combination of customer_id, order_id, 
                  and order_date in an orders table could form a super key.
                
              6. Candidate Key: 
                      candidate key is a signle column or more than 
                       one column like name,rollnumber , email phone number 
                    are candidate key</pre>

             Q.1: What is a Unique Key?
                Unique Keys are the keys that define the
                record uniquely in the table. It is different 
                from Primary Keys, as Unique Key can contain 
               one NULL value but Primary Key does not contain
               any NULL values.

             Q.2: Why keys are necessary for DBMS?

                Keys are one of the important aspects of DBMS. 
                Keys help us to find the tuples(rows) uniquely 
                in the table.It is also used in developing various
                relations amongst columns or tables of the database.
            </pre>


<pre>





      Alternate Key
      The candidate key other than the primary key is called an alternate key.
      
      All the keys which are not primary keys are called alternate keys.
      It is a secondary key.
      It contains two or more fields to identify two or more records.
      These values are repeated.
      Eg:- SNAME, and ADDRESS is Alternate keys
      Example:
      
      
      
      Artificial <keygen>
An artificial key in databases refers to
 a type of key that is created specifically
  for the purpose of uniquely identifying records
   within a table. Unlike a natural key, which is 
   derived from data that already exists within the database
    (such as a person's social security number or an employee's 
    email address), an artificial key is generated solely for database
     management purposes.

                  SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming 
                  language designed for managing and querying relational databases.
                  Here are some key aspects and features of SQL:
    
    Data Querying: SQL allows users to retrieve and manipulate data 
                   stored in a relational database. The SELECT statement 
                   is used to query data from one or more tables.
    
    Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands like INSERT, UPDATE,
                       and DELETE to manipulate data in the database 
                       tables. These commands allow users to add new records, 
                       modify existing ones, and delete unnecessary data.
    
    Data Definition: SQL includes commands such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP for 
                     defining and managing database schema and structures. These 
                     commands are used to create new tables, modify existing table 
                     structures, and drop tables or other database objects.
    
    Data Control:   SQL provides commands like GRANT and REVOKE to control access 
                   to the database objects. These commands manage user permissions
                    and security settings, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
    
    Transactions: SQL supports transactional processing, allowing multiple SQL 
                  statements to be grouped together into a single unit of work. 
                  This ensures that either all operations within the transaction 
                  are successfully completed (COMMIT), or none of them are (ROLLBACK), 
                  maintaining database consistency.
    
    Constraints: SQL allows users to define constraints such as PRIMARY KEY,
                  FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK constraints. These constraints
                   enforce data integrity rules and ensure that data stored in the
                    database remains accurate and consistent.
    
    Joins: SQL supports different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN,
               FULL JOIN) to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related
                column between them. Joins enable complex queries that retrieve data
                 from multiple tables simultaneously.
    
    Aggregation: SQL provides aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT) to perform
                 calculations on sets of rows. These functions allow users to summarize 
                 and analyze data stored in the database.
    
    Subqueries: SQL supports subqueries, allowing users to nest one query within another. 
                 Subqueries can be used to retrieve data conditionally or to perform 
                 calculations based on the results of another query.
    
    Views: SQL allows users to create virtual tables known as views. Views are defined 
             by queries and present data from one or more tables in a structured format. 
             They can simplify complex queries and provide a layer of abstraction over 
             the underlying database schema.
    
         SQL is a declarative language, meaning users specify what data 
         they want to retrieve or manipulate without necessarily specifying 
         how to do it. Different database management systems (DBMS) implement 
         SQL with slight variations, often referred to as dialects.Common 
         SQL-based DBMS include PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle Database, Microsoft 
         SQL Server, and others.

                    <pre>
                        In the context of databases, a constraint 
                        is a rule or restriction applied to data in 
                        a database table. Constraints enforce specific 
                        conditions that the data must meet, ensuring data 
                        integrity and helping to maintain the accuracy and 
                        reliability of the data within the database.
