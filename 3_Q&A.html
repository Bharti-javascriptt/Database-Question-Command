1.      ODBC: opend database connectivity 
that is sql based programming interface
introduced by microsoft

2.         Function of DBMS: storing data, 
 providing multi-users access control
 data integrity

4         DBMS acts as an interface between two
component of an interprise-class
database system: Database and database
 application 
5             Database environment component are : 
user, databse, database administrator
except : seperate files 

6 DATABASE Program : Mysql, oracle, Base 
7 Writer is not a database program 
8 DBMS : it is not a language, it stores  
modifies and retrieve  data basciealtty it  is a  
software application

        1. Founder of Relational & DATABASE is:
           Model of Database: Edeger F Codd
        
        2. DBA: Data base administrator 

        3 Between the user and database
          itself a DBMS will act as: Interface
        
        4 A computer file contain several record
                            (mongodb : document)
          what does each record contain : field 
          collection of field is called record
        
        5 Data are:  Raw Fact and Figure

        6 Data processing cycle consist of : 
                       input, output, processing cycle

        7 DBMS is Used for:Eliminate data redundancy
                          (repetion of data)
                          Maintain data integrity
                          Establish relationship among files 
                          Data consistency
        
        8 Data dictionary(Meta data) tell the DBMS?
             Data about data
             files are in dbatabase
             attribute possessed by the data
             what file contains


        9 Oracle= is a Hierarchical database 
          IDMS( integrated database management system ) : network database


        10 DataProcessing:  capturing storing, updating retrieving
                            modifying data

        11 The highest level in the hierarchy of data organization is called
              Database and smallest is bit
              
              
        12  Files is : Collection of record  is called file 
          
        13 The distinguishable parts of a "records" are called :Field 
        collection of filed is called record


        14 Meta data regarded as : data dictionary = data about data
          

        15 Periodically changing file : is called updating of file

        16 Administrative supervision of database activities is the 
           responsibility of  : DBA

        17 Key represent relationship between table is called  Foreign key 

        18 In relational model(Means RDBMS) cardinality is termed as : 
                        Number of tuples 

        19 In relational model Relation are termed as : Tables
            option: tuple, attribute, row, column,tables
        
        20 DML : stands for data manipulation and processing of data

        </pre>

        21 Database schema(means structure) is written in :  DDl 
                                       data definition language


        22 The language used in application program to request data from 
             the dbms is reffered as : DML
              

        23 Related field in a database are grouped to form a : Record
                 
        24 Databae environment has : files record database, dba 
                                 accept users
        25 the method in which record are physically stored in a 
           specified order according to the key field in each record  is 
           Ans: hash method 
        
        26 Rdbms terminology row : tuple , column = attribute
        
        27 one of the following is valid record base data model: Relational Model
            option : object oriented model, entity relationship model, SAP, Rdbms
            all are database model but best is Relational model 

        28  Choose the dbms which support full fledged client application and server 
           application development : Oracle 7.1 

        29 the set of all possible values of data items is called: Domain 

        30  the program that enables you to create  access and manage Whole database 
             is  called : DBMS  


        31 which of the following popular software that support dBms: ms access 
          Option:   ms access,ms word, msexcel, ms paint wordpad 

        32 initial code name of ms access is : cirrus 
        33 When a access file saved what file format does it take 
        Extension of ms access file is .MDB 
        .PSD photoshop, .CDR coreldraw, 
        34 in Ms access row in a table represent Records 
        35 What is the max character a filed name can contain in ms access: 64character 
        ms access me field name ko kkitne character se represent kyia ja sakta hai
        36 Typs  of data model objectt  oriented database model
